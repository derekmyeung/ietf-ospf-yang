    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model that can be 
      used to configure and manage OSPF.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Overview">
      <t>YANG <xref target="RFC6020"></xref> is a data definition language 
      used to define the contents of a conceptual data store 
      that allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF 
      <xref target="RFC6241"></xref>.  YANG is proving relevant beyond its 
      initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces (e.g., ReST) and 
      encodings other than XML (e.g., JSON) are being defined.  Furthermore, 
      YANG data models can be used as the basis for implementation of other 
      interfaces, such as CLI and programmatic APIs.</t>

    <t>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure 
    and manage OSPF and it is an augmentation to the core routing data model.  
    A core routing data model is defined in 
    <xref target="RFC8022"></xref>, 
    and it provides the basis for the development of data models for routing 
    protocols.  The interface data model is defined in 
    <xref target="RFC7223"></xref> and is used for referencing 
    interfaces from the routing protocol. The key-chain data model used for
    OSPF authentication is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-yang-key-chain"></xref> 
    and provides both a reference to configured key-chains and an 
    enumeration of cryptographic algorithms.</t>
     
    <t>Both OSPFv2 <xref target="RFC2328"></xref> and OSPFv3 
    <xref target="RFC5340"></xref> are supported.  In addition to 
    the core OSPF protocol, features described in other 
    OSPF RFCs are also supported. These includes demand circuit 
    <xref target="RFC1793"></xref>, traffic engineering <xref target="RFC3630"></xref>,
    multiple address family <xref target="RFC5838"></xref>, graceful restart 
    <xref target="RFC3623"></xref> <xref target="RFC5187"></xref>, 
    NSSA <xref target="RFC3101"></xref>, and OSPF(v3) as a PE-CE Protocol 
    <xref target="RFC4577"></xref>, <xref target="RFC6565"></xref>.
    These non-core features are optional in the OSPF data model.</t>      
             
      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
  
    <section title="Design of Data Model">
    <t>Although the basis of OSPF configuration elements like routers, 
    areas, and interfaces remains the same, the detailed configuration
    model varies among router vendors.  Differences are observed in terms
    of how the protocol engine is tied to the routing domain, how multiple
    protocol engines are be instantiated, and configuration inheritance,
    among others.</t>
    <t>The goal of this document is to define a data model that provides a common user 
    interface to the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols. There is very little information that is 
    designated as "mandatory", providing freedom for vendors to adapt this data model to their 
    respective product implementations.</t>
    
    <section title="Overview">
    <t>The OSPF YANG module defined in this document has all the common building
   blocks for the OSPF protocol.</t>
    <t>The OSPF YANG module augments the routing/routing-instance/routing-protocols/routing-protocol 
    path defined in the ietf-routing module.</t>

    <figure align="center">
      <artwork align="left">
//@@@@
      </artwork>
    </figure>
    <t>The ospf module is intended to match to the vendor specific 
    OSPF configuration construct that is identified by the local identifier 'name'. 
    The field 'version' allows support for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</t>

    <t>The ospf container includes one or more OSPF protocol engines, each 
    enclosed in a separate instance entity.  Each instance includes information 
    for the routing domain based on the [routing-instance af] specification.
    There is no default routing domain assumed by the data model. For example,
    to enable OSPF on a vendor's default IPv4 routing domain, an explicit instance 
    entity with a specification like ["default" "ipv4-unicast"] is required. 
    The instance also contains OSPF router level configuration</t>
    
    <t>The instance/area and instance/area/interface containers respectively
    define the OSPF configuration for OSPF areas and interfaces.</t>

    <t>The instance/topology container defines the OSPF 
    configuration for OSPF topologies when the multi-topology feature is supported.</t>
        
    </section>

    <section title="OSPFv2 and OSPFv3">
      <t>The data model defined herein supports both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</t>
      <t>The field 'version' is used to indicate the OSPF version and is
      mandatory.  Based on the configured version, the data model varies
      to accommodate the differences between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Optional Features">
      <t>Optional features are beyond the basic OSPF configuration and
      it is the responsibility of each vendor to decide whether to 
      support a given feature on a particular device.</t>
      <t>This model defines a number of features, such as NSR, max-LSA,
      etc.  It is expected that vendors will support additional 
      features through vendor specific augmentations.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Inheritance">
      <t>This data model supports configuration inheritance at different levels 
      including instance-level, area-level, and interface-level inheritance.</t>
      <t>The all-instances-inherit, all-areas-inherit, and all-interfaces-inherit 
      containers are defined to provide a consistent way to configure inheritable 
      configuration parameters. For example, parameters defined in the 
      all-instances-inherit container apply to all OSPF instances. However, a 
      particular instance configuration can include leaves that 
      override this inheritance.</t>
      <t>Inheritance is defined as an optional feature, and vendors are 
      permitted to augment the inheritance containers with their own
      vendor specific parameters.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="OSPF Router Configuration">
    <t>The ospf container is the top level container in this data model. It contains 
    shared information among the OSPF instances configured within the container.

      </section>
    <section title="OSPF Instance Configuration">
    <t>The instance container represents an OSPF protocol engine and contains
    the router level configuration.  The routing domain for each instance
    is dictated through the specification of [routing-instance af].</t>
    <t>The all-areas-inherit container contains area configuration that 
    may be inherited by configured OSPF areas in the OSPF instance.</t>

    may be inherited by all OSPF area interfaces.</t>

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
